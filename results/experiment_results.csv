nomic-embed-text,chroma,300,50,basic,5.43861198425293,423968768,What is an AVL Tree?,"An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. This balancing property ensures that operations like search, insert, and delete maintain O(log n) time complexity. The goal of an AVL tree is to keep the balance factor (the difference in height between the left and right subtrees) within a valid range (-1 to 1). When the balance factor becomes 2 or -2, rebalancing is required to restore the balance property.",11.837814092636108
