nomic-embed-text,redis,300,50,basic,4.224596261978149,246153216,What is Redis?,"Redis is a data structure store that primarily functions as a key-value (KV) store, but it can also be used with other models such as graph spatial full-text search vector time series and is capable of supporting ranking systems. It provides 16 databases by default, numbered from 0 to 15. Redis allows for direct interaction through a set of commands related to setting and getting key-value pairs and variations, with many language libraries available.",41.0007860660553
nomic-embed-text,chroma,300,50,basic,5.292290210723877,448643072,What is an AVL Tree?,"An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. This balancing property ensures that operations like search, insert, and delete maintain O(log n) time complexity. The balance factor of any node in an AVL tree is valid if it's 1, 0, or -1, indicating whether the subtree is left-heavy, right-heavy, or balanced respectively. When the balance factor becomes 2 or -2, rebalancing is required to maintain the balance property.",13.208866119384766
